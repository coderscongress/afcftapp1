Great — ready when you are! Let's begin testing the AfCFTAChatbot component and other product/vendor features in your AfCFTApp.

To proceed efficiently, I suggest we walk through these key checkpoints. Let me know which ones you’d like to focus on first — or we can go through all:

✅ 1. AfCFTAChatbot Component Functionality
We'll verify:

 Input/submit behavior (message typing and sending)

 Correct routing to /api/chatbot

 Proper reply handling (res.json({ reply }))

 Display of simulated results for keywords like product, tariff, etc.

 Fallback to OpenAI response when no keyword match

Test suggestions:

Input: "List available products"

Input: "Show tariff rates"

Input: "How does AfCFTA work?" (should trigger GPT response)

✅ 2. Product Search & Summary Features
Verify:

 Product listing loads correctly from your backend

 Search/filter functionality

 Click-to-view detail or summary

 PDF summary download works (via generateProductSummaryPDF)

 Quantity and cart logic work (if cart is integrated)

✅ 3. Vendor Information Features
Check:

 Vendor listing is connected to product codes

 Vendor details display correctly when clicked

 WhatsApp/email contact integration works

 Relevant trade or compliance info (e.g. AfCFTA eligibility, TIN, certifications)

✅ 4. Order Placement (if implemented)
Test:

 Add to cart

 WhatsApp or email order sending

 Order receipt PDF generation (via generateAfCFTACorporateForm)

✅ 5. General UI + Routing Checks
 Can switch between pages/components smoothly?

 Dark mode toggle?

 Any console errors in DevTools?

✅ How would you like to proceed?
Want to test the chatbot now (and I can walk you through the POST to /api/chatbot)?

Or prefer to start with product/vendor listing tests?

If you want to share the current frontend code snippet for AfCFTAChatbot.tsx, I can double-check if it's wired correctly too.
