//Update Firebase Hosting to Support SPA Routing
//In your firebase.json, add a rewrites rule like this:


{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "build", // or "dist" depending on your framework
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ]
  }
}

//This tells Firebase Hosting to serve your React app for any route (/chat, /chat/room-id, etc.), so the router can take over.
