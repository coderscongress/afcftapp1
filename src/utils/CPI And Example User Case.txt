Commodity Price Indexes: Show real-time price changes in the global market (like NYMEX for crude oil or the London Bullion Market for gold) and allow users to base their trades on the most current prices.

Example Use Case:
*************Scenario: A Nigerian oil trader wants to buy 500,000 barrels of crude oil from a supplier in Algeria.

AfCFTAGoodsCatalog: The Nigerian trader searches for crude oil in the app and selects the Algeria supplier.

AfCFTATariffCalculator: The app calculates tariffs and trade exemptions, displaying any discounts or special rates available under AfCFTA.

AfCFTACurrencyExchange: It calculates the equivalent price of crude oil in Naira (NGN) based on the current exchange rate from Algerian Dinar (DZD).

AfCFTASmartContractManager: A smart contract is created, specifying the quantity (500,000 barrels), price, and shipment details.

AfCFTAGlobalLogistics: The oil is shipped from Algeria, and the trader can track its movement in real-time.

AfCFTADisputeResolution: If any issues arise regarding the shipment or quality, the trader can use the dispute resolution system.

Conclusion:
This system can enable AfCFTA member states to trade gold, cocoa, crude oil, and other commodities in a streamlined, automated, and transparent manner. By incorporating smart contracts, currency conversions, tariffs, compliance checks, and logistics tracking, the app makes cross-border trade more efficient and accessible to both small and large traders.
